# Trash or Not Trash (TONT)

### What is this
This is a project dedicated to using computer vision and deep learning in order to identify trash/garbage/refuse on video streams. 

### Ultimate Vision
The goal of project is to evolve into a fleet/swarm of solar-powered robots that will autonomously travel around cities and countries collecting trash. Collection facilities will then sort the collected refuse into three categories: unrecyclable, recyclable, and compostable

### Initial Product
#### Hardware
The initial physical design of the robot will consist of a project board with two motors and a camera. No garbage collecting mechanism is slated for development yet--the first goal is to recognize litter, move to that litter, and indicate it has found litter by turning on a light.

#### Software
On the software front, initial data will need to be collected for labeled training data. This labeled training data will start with identifying paper refuse as well as waste receptacles.

#### First Phase
With the hardware and software in mind, the first phase of this robot is to identify and collect paper refuse, house paper refuse, identify public waste receptacles, and deposit paper waste into the receptacle. Additionally an initial platform needs to be created for manual control of the robot, which will then be superceded by autonomous control. Arguably this needs to be broken down into more pieces, and this will be done once more research and tinkering has been performed.
